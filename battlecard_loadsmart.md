## Company Overview
Here is a detailed company overview of Loadsmart:

Loadsmart is a logistics technology company that provides freight brokerage, shipping, carrier, and warehouse services to empower businesses to move more with less. Founded in 2014, the company has reached 10 years of innovation and resilience, evolving from a freight brokerage to a next-gen logistics solutions provider. Headquartered in the United States, Loadsmart has a strategic focus on building a unified execution layer, leveraging technology to improve logistics operations, and supporting its growth into a profitable hybrid freight platform.

Loadsmart offers a range of services and solutions, including managed transportation, freight mode optimization, multimodal transport, and shipping services for shippers, carriers, and warehouses. The company's platform provides instant, dynamic capacity to move overland freight, and its integrations with transportation management systems (TMS) such as MercuryGate, e2open, and Blue Yonder enable real-time market rates and automated booking.

Loadsmart has acquired Kamion, an intelligent trucking management system, and Opendock, a company that offers warehouse dock scheduling software, to solve for supply chain inefficiencies. The company has also developed FreightIntel AI, which allows users to rapidly identify opportunities to improve logistics operations.
